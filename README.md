ansible-role-monit
==================

An Ansible role, available via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com), that installs and configures monit on Ubuntu.

This role works with [our repo to create a vagrant virtualbox vm](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-roles-vagrant), but is easily modifed to work with actual ubuntu boxes.

You'll probably want to amend / override:

* `defaults/main.yml`

Installation
------------

Preusming a `requirements.yml` as follows:

    # Install a role from GitHub
    - name: ansible-role-monit
    src: https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-monit

we can install the role locally:

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml -p ./roles

You may already have:

* Created a vagrant VirtualBox virtual machine using [ansible-roles-vagrant](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-users)
* Provisioned the virtual machine with users using [ansible-role-users](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-users)
* Installled various common packages using [ansible_role_common](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-role-common)

Role Variables
--------------

Available variables are listed below, along with default values as found in `defaults/main.yml`:

    site:
      app: site
      host: localhost.vagrant
      user: administrator
      password: whatever

    ansible_role_monit:
      email: whoever@wherever.com
      port: 9999
      user: "{{ site.user }}"
      password: "{{ site.password }}"
      domain: "monit.{{ site.host }}"
      host: "{{ site.host }}"

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Our `hosts` file, as generated by [our repo to create a vagrant virtualbox vm](https://github.com/jcdarwin/ansible-roles-vagrant):

    [vagrant]
    host1 ansible_ssh_host=127.0.0.1 ansible_ssh_port=2222 ansible_user=vagrant ansible_ssh_private_key_file=../.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key

We include a playbook at `main.yml`.

Running the playbook:

    # Note that we're presuming our hosts file has been generated by our vagrant repo
    ansible all -m ping -i ../vagrant/ansible/hosts -l all

    ansible-playbook -l all main.yml -i ../vagrant/ansible/hosts

    # Check that php has been installed
    ansible -m shell -a 'monit -V' all -i ../vagrant/ansible/hosts

To see the results in the browser (presuming you're using the defaults):

	# Add the subdomain to our hosts file
	echo "127.0.0.1	monit.localhost.vagrant"

	# then visit: http://monit.localhost.vagrant:9999
